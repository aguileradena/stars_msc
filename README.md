# stars_msc
Files to reproduce the models and figures in my master thesis.

The text from my master thesis can be found [here](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/thesis/david_master.pdf).

It uses two sets of stellar evolutionary models made with Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics ([MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/)), an open-source 1D stellar evolution code.

A MESA template will be added here, and a zenodo repository containing the data will also be created soon.

Also, jupyter notebooks containing the scripts used to analyse the data will be found here.
